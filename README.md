Hangman Coding Challenge for OIT Position

I do not have any experience with Python documentation, 
so I tried to make my comments as specific as necessary to know what's happening
within each respective function.

When the program asks if you want to go again or not, 
I use classic terminal syntax in the sense that if you press enter (whitespace)
it will consider it as a yes and continue the program. 

I spent a total of 3 hours on this challenge. 
I will include details about my thought processes in my handwritten notes.
I wrote everything in my notes down before starting to program.
I'll have a section specifically stated in my notes as after thoughts of
what I didn't see before programming that I needed to change mid process.

Thank you!
