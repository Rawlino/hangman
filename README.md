Hangman Coding Challenge for OIT Position

I do not have any experience with Python documentation, 
so I tried to make my comments as specific as necessary to know what's happening
within each respective function.

When the program asks if you want to go again or not, 
I use classic terminal syntax in the sense that if you press enter (whitespace)
it will consider it as a yes and continue the program.
